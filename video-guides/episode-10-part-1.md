{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8tgc8I-dQs" %}

Welcome back to my guide, helping you create a Discord Bot using the amazing Discord.js library I hope you follow along and create your very own bot!

We made some nice embeds for the moderation action logs in the previous episode, but we never did manage to get the case numbers \(or mod log numbers\) actually working, in this episode we do! as well as fix some major issues I completely glossed over!

Please let me know what you think to the series, and suggest things for me to cover in future episodes, I have a mental road map I will be following, but I may throw in the odd episode dedicated to requests.
