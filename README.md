# Welcome

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide is for Discord.js v12. For v13, once it is released, please see the [Official Discordjs.Guide](https://discordjs.guide/)
{% endhint %}

This guide makes a best effort attempt at humanizing the use of the Discord.js library, in its current version 13 iteration. It is maintained by York\#0001 and Discordaholic\#0001 \("Evie.Codes"\), with the help of many precious contributors that enable us to keep updating and enhancing this guide.

It was born out of necessity - the first version of this guide for Discord.js version 7, more than 5 years ago, was the first of its kind because I \(Evie\) could not find any such beginner's guide and the documentation was \(and still is\) unfathomably difficult to navigate for anyone without a sufficiently advanced knowledge of JavaScript concepts.

In this guide we make every effort to _teach_ you how to use the library and how to extend it with your own code. We do, however expect you to have a basic understanding of JavaScript before attempting to write bots. Discord.js \(and other discord libraries\) require some median-to-advanced concepts that might be hard to grasp for anyone that doesn't have a good footing with the language.
