## What even is this?

This guide makes a best effort attempt at humanizing the use of the Discord.JS library, in its current version 13 iteration. It is maintained by York#0001 and Discordaholic#0001 *("Evie.Codes")*, with the help of many precious contributors that enable us to keep updating and enhancing this guide.

## How did it start?

It was born out of necessity - the first version of this guide for Discord.js version 7, more than 5 years ago, was the first of its kind because I *(Evie)* could not find any such beginner's guide and the documentation was *(and still is)* unfathomably difficult to navigate for anyone without a sufficiently advanced knowledge of JavaScript concepts.

In this guide we make every effort to _teach_ you how to use the library and how to extend it with your own code. We do, however expect you to have a basic understanding of JavaScript before attempting to write bots. Discord.js *(and other discord libraries)* require some median-to-advanced concepts that might be hard to grasp for anyone that doesn't have a good footing with the language.
